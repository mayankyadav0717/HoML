## Datasets

The `datasets` directory contains data used in the notebooks. Ensure that the datasets are properly loaded to replicate the results.

## Installation

To run the notebooks, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mayankyadav0717/HoML.git
   cd HoML
   ```
2. **Set up a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
